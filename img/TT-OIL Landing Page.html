            TTOIL started out as a fuel oil and a VGO trader, and this is what we are really good at. Every month we move over 1 million tons of heavy feedstocks. Half of this is used by refineries to supplement their incoming crude streams, andthe other half as blendstock for bunker fuel. <br><br>
Our fuel oil trading geography is extensive. We source fuel oil and VGO from Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Algeria, West Africa and take it to major trading hubs including Rotterdam, Fujairah, Singapore, Turkey or directly to refineries. We serve marine bunker markets through long term partnerships with fleet owners and bunkering companies. We add value by carefully selecting incoming streams, using our extensive terminal network to store and blend them where required, maintaining the quality throughout.
